## Heyyy! I work across code, cognition, and creation.


### 🎨 Domains Of My Work & Thinking

- ✨ AI/ML — Architecting MLLMs, Fine-Tuning, Data-Engineering.
- 🔍 Theoretical Physics & Philosophy — Exploring Structure, Consciousness, Governing Ideology.
- 🪶 Poetry & Language — Poems, Mostly in English, a few in Hindi — Records of Love, Silence, and Time, which I Am Oblivious to.
- 🔮 Psyche — Mapping Human Inner Architectures through Intuition and Clashing into Different Ideologies.

### 🌚 My Principles
> **I Prefer to Run things locally, Control Every Parameter, and Understand Each Layer from Mechanics to Interface.**
> **Must Learn From Every Failed Attempt.**
> **Code Must be Purposed with Efficacy, While Verses Must be Rhythmic.**

### 💤 Current Work
 
- **Building Omni MLLMs That Can Talk, See, Hear & Sculpt 3D Mesh.**
